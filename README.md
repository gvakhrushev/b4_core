# B4

**Deterministic, non-custodial execution of a Bitcoin-cycle hold strategy.**

A user deposits a directional asset plus canonical USDC into an isolated vault and picks two
target exposures — one for the growth regime, one for the fall regime. Time since the last
proven Bitcoin halving selects and interpolates the active target. One external fact, one
venue (HyperEVM + HyperCore), one accounting model, no admin.

## How it works

    subgraph CIT ["Citrea"]
        PROVER["HalvingProver<br/><i>re-verifies the 80-byte header</i>"]
    end

    subgraph HE ["HyperEVM"]

        VAULT["B4Vault clone<br/><i>custody + accounting + async engine</i>"]
        POOL["B4Pool<br/><i>penalty inventory, weights, claims</i>"]
    end

    CORE[("HyperCore<br/>one execution identity per vault")]
    OWNER(["Owner"])
    KEEPER(["Keeper — anyone"])

    BTC --> PROVER
    PROVER -- "LayerZero" --> ORACLE
    ORACLE --> VAULT
    FACTORY -. clones .-> VAULT
    FACTORY -. deploys .-> POOL
    VAULT -- "emits actions" --> CORE
    CORE -- "state reads prove execution" --> VAULT
    VAULT -- "penalty, in kind" --> POOL
    POOL -- "claims, in kind" --> OWNER
    OWNER -- "deposit · selectPolicy · exit" --> VAULT
    KEEPER -. crank .-> VAULT
```

Three properties define the system:

- **The calendar is a pure function of block time.** Nobody — owner, operator or keeper —
  chooses the regime, the target, the market or the price.
- **Execution is asynchronous and proven, never assumed.** Emitting a CoreWriter action is not
  evidence it executed; the effect must be proven by a later Core state read, and accounting
  credits the *measured balance delta*, never the requested amount. Donations and favourable
  overfills stay unaccounted and separately recoverable.
- **Authority is minimal.** No upgrade proxy, no pause, no privileged fund mover. The worst
  case of any stalled step is delayed liveness, never loss of funds.

## The products

Each product is the previous one plus one more interior move at the two cycle pivots.
`φ = 1.618033988749894848`.

| Product | Growth | Fall | Adds |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Mini | `1` | `1` | holds spot, trades nothing; earns pool yield |
| B4 | `1` | `0` | a fall-regime rotation into USDC |
| Pro | `1` | `−1/φ` | a hedge — short in the fall regime |
| Pro Max | `φ` | `−φ` | leveraged expression of the same signs |

A signed target `n` decomposes exactly once, identically for every product:

```
spot = clamp(n, 0, 1)     // directional spot
perp = n − spot           // residual the spot leg cannot express
```

How much accepted holding risk to keep is the user's dial; the protocol takes no directional
view on their behalf.

## The cycle

The two pivots are **not fitted to price history** — they are the golden-ratio self-division
of the interval, so the model carries **zero tuned parameters**. Any other boundary would have
to be calibrated against the handful of completed cycles.

| Pivot | Formula | Share of cycle | Nominal day |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `P` growth → fall | `cycle/φ²` | 38.20 % | ≈ 557.7 d |
| `T` fall → growth | `cycle/φ` | 61.80 % | ≈ 902.3 d |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    G["<b>Growth</b><br/>1.47 y"]
    CG["Closing<br/>10 d ✅"]
    S1{{"⚑ Settlement<br/>P−H"}}
    OF["Opening fall<br/>10 d ✅ ⛔"]
    F["<b>Fall</b><br/>0.94 y"]
    CF["Closing<br/>10 d ✅"]
    S2{{"⚑ Settlement<br/>T+H"}}
    OG["Opening growth<br/>10 d ✅ ⛔"]
    TG["<b>Terminal growth</b><br/>1.47 y"]

    G --> CG --> S1 --> OF --> F --> CF --> S2 --> OG --> TG
    TG -. "next halving ⇒ t = 0" .-> G
```

✅ free exit · ⛔ deposits closed · nominal cycle `1460 d`, transitions `W = 20 d`, halves
`H = 10 d`. A sign change always passes through a verified zero at a settlement point;
strictly same-sign pairs interpolate directly and never synthesise one — which is why Mini
never trades, yet is still fee'd on interval profit.

Details: [Core concepts](docs/02-core-concepts.md).

## Historical demo

The four products' exposure path run over real BTC daily closes — through the **protocol's
own `Calendar` library**, so the demo tracks the deployed arithmetic rather than a
re-implementation that could drift from it.

```bash
forge test --match-path 'test/backtest/*' -vv
```

Return by cycle, each starting at `1.0x` (max drawdown in brackets):

| Cycle | Mini | B4 | Pro | Pro Max | HODL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2012→2016 | 49.6x (85%) | 122.7x (74%) | 171.3x (74%) | 374.4x (**97%**) | 51.9x (84%) |
| 2016→2020 | 12.9x (84%) | 52.8x (64%) | 72.8x (64%) | 292.1x (86%) | 13.5x (83%) |
| 2020→2024 | 7.1x (77%) | 27.1x (53%) | 41.4x (53%) | 226.5x (74%) | 7.4x (76%) |
| 2024→now* | 0.99x (54%) | 1.68x (28%) | 2.06x (28%) | 2.76x (46%) | 1.00x (53%) |

<sub>\* cycle in progress, one settlement so far</sub>

## Versioning: no upgrade path, by design

Every contract is immutable — no proxy, no pause, no admin who can reach into a live vault.
Safety comes from correctness by construction plus the owner's exit right, the same model as
Bitcoin and Uniswap V1/V2/V3.

The consequence is explicit: **a fix is a new deployment, not a patch.** A defect in `v1` is
addressed by deploying a re-audited `v2` alongside it; `v1` keeps running exactly as written.
Vaults are clones bound to their implementation and do not migrate automatically — a user
moves by exiting and re-entering, which is free inside a transition window and otherwise costs
the ordinary exit penalty.

## Build & test

Requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/); Solidity `0.8.28` is pinned in `foundry.toml`.

```bash
forge build --sizes   # every contract must fit EIP-170
forge fmt --check
forge test            # unit + integration + invariant campaigns

FOUNDRY_PROFILE=deep forge test --match-path 'test/invariant/*'   # nightly deep profile
slither . --fail-high                                            # release gate, also in CI
```

## Security

Report vulnerabilities privately — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Please do not open a
public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

There is no admin key and no pause, so a live deployment cannot be halted; that is precisely
why pre-deployment reports matter.
